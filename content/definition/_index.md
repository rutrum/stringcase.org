Definition of terms and concepts that formally describe string case and case conversion.

The unicode standard has already done a extraordinary amount of rigor behind defining characters in the context of all languages, and how all features of written language can be described in a single binary format.  This definition draws from unicode's specification where it is appropriate.

In particular, chapter 4.2 introduces the idea of a _case_.
