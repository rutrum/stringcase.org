A _multi-word identifier_, or _identifier_ for short, is a string composed of one or more words.  Representing words as a single identifier involves joining words together, typically in a manner than makes the individual words distinguishable from one another.  How those words are mutated and joined is defined by a case.

A string is data structure that represents a list of characters with known length.  Depending on the context, you may refer to an identifier as just a string.  Hence, we refer to _identifier case_ more colloquially as _string case_.
