A multiword identifier is a single string that represent a series of words.  Each word is formatted with a certain word case, then joined together with an optional delimiter.  The format of the words, known as a pattern, along with the delimeter is what we will call a _string case_, or simply, a _case_.

$$\text{case} \coloneqq (\text{pattern}, \text{delimiter})$$

This definition aligns with colloquial uses of variable cases in programming languages.  For example, _snake case_ is the lower pattern with underscore delimiter.  For a list of names given to particular pattern, delimiter pairs, see [cases](/cases).
