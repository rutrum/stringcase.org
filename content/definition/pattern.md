A _case pattern_, or rather, _pattern_ is a series of word patterns.  It describes how each word in a multiword identify is word-cased.

The following is a table of cases:

| pattern name | series |  example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lower | lower, lower, ... | my word list |
| upper | upper, upper, ... | MY WORD LIST |
| capitalized | capitalized, capitalized, ... | My Word List |
| sentence | capitalized, lower, lower, ... | My word list |
| camel | lower, capitalized, capitalized, ... | my Word List |
