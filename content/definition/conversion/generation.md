**Theres got to be a better name than this.**  Consolidation?

Generation is relatively easy when compared to segmentation.  Each element represents two the two composing operations:

## Mutation

The pattern of the case defines how to mutate each word in the word list.

## Joining

The delimeter then describes how the words should be concatenated.  To perform joining, all words are concatenated together with the delimiter in between each word.  This can be called interspersing.
