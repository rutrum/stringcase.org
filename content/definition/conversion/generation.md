**Theres got to be a better name than this.**

Generation is relatively easy when compared to segmentation.  Each part (**whats a piece of a tuple called?**) represents two the two composing operations:

## Mutation

The pattern of the case defines how to mutate each word in the word list.

## Joining

The delimeter then describes how the words should be concatenated.  To perform joining, all words are concatenated together with the delimiter in between each word.
