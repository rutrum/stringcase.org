What citations should be used when refering to naming conventions?  Unforunately, wikipedia and other listical articles will source stack overflow threads of the source of the name of a case.  [This stackoverflow thread in particular](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17326185/what-are-the-different-kinds-of-cases) has a list of cases each with names.  But do these names hold any weight?

If this site serves to select and define actual case naming conventions, then it should source reputable articles and documentation as the source of conventions and it's usage.

I'd like to keep references to the following:
* Programming language documentation itself
* Style guides by large companies (Google style guide, for instance)
* Stack overflow/reddit/etc threads only when refering to the thread itself (for instance, kebab case)
* Very old email threads for originating terminology

There are some notable exceptions, like the cases that aren't exclusive to programming, but human language.

The goal is to _not_ source articles like the following:
* Case conversion libraries
* Listicals that discuss case naming conventions directly
* Style guides that are not well known or made by a single person
