_Constant case_ is the upper pattern with underscore `_` delimiter.

Constant case is also known as _upper snake case_ or _screaming snake case_.

## History

Constant refers to a property of variables in programming languages.  Constant variables never change value after being initialized.  In the C programming language, the convention is to write these variables in what we refer to as constant case.

Languages such as Java refer to this type of variable as `final` but is cased the same.
