Some "cases" are either not practical for programming or break the formal definition of a case.  These transformations still depend on the word-by-word or letter-by-letter transformations of case.  They are niche.

_Alternating case_ refers to words whose letters alternate between uppercase and lowercase.

## tOGGLE cASE

_Toggle case_ refers to words that begin with a lowercase letter, proceeded by uppercase letters.  This is the opposite of how people would typically write in sentence or title case.  As such, the process of converting lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice-versa is called _toggling_.

_Random case_ refers to words that have letters cases in no particular order, or randomly.  _Pseudorandom case_ then refers to words that alternate not quite completely randomly, but also not deterministically like alternating case.

This style was popularized by a meme, and has since been used to say something in a mocking or sarcastic tone.

## s u r r e a l c a s e

_Surreal case_ refers to words that have spaces between each letter.  This is a reference to a formatting choice in surreal memes.

## Leading and Trailing Delimieters

Programming languages that use symbols to prefix identifiers sometimes consider those identifiers to follow a different case.  For example, [Python PEP 0008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles) defines a list of conventions, some of which we would define as cases, along with names for identifiers with underscore prefixes, such as `__double_leading_underscore` and `single_trailing_underscore_`.  The Python also uses functions that define additional functionality on objects that both preceed and proceed the name with double underscores.  They called these _dunder_ methods, for double under.
