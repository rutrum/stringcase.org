_Upper case_ is the upper pattern with space delimiter.

Upper case is also known as _all caps_.

## Usage

Upper case is used in typography for a variety of meanings.  In writing of documents, it can be used by the writer to imply screaming or shouting.

This is distinct from _small caps_, which is the use of different fonts that use lowercase letter glyphs in the style of uppercase glyphs, but smaller in size.
