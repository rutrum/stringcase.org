_Pascal case_ is the capital pattern with empty string delimiter.

Pascal case is also known as _upper camel case_.

## History

Pascal is a case-insensitive language, so the same identifier can be referenced using a different mixture of upper and lowercase letters each time.

This document[^1] with footer dating it at 1998 suggests Pascal case for most identifiers, additionally describing prefixes to prepend to certain types. (**todo: figure out what what convention is called**).

This other document[^2] calls Pascal case _infix caps_.  It suggests using infix caps for all identifiers.

The GNU Pascal manual[^3], last updated in 2005, describes Pascal case as the following:

> Only the first letter should be capital, or, if there are concatenated words or acronyms, the first letter of each word should be capital â€“ do not use underscores. 

Additionally, it comments on acronyms.

> Acronyms that have become part of the natural language can be written like that.

## Examples

Rust uses Pascal case for struct, enum, and trait names.

```rust {filename="Rust"}
enum Answer {
    MoreThanOnce,
    ExactlyOnce,
    Never,
}

impl TryFrom<i32> for Answer {
    type Error = ();

    fn try_from(num: i32) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        match num {
            i if i == 0 => Ok(Answer::Never),
            i if i == 1 => Ok(Answer::ExactlyOnce),
            i if i > 1 => Ok(Answer::MoreThanOnce),
            _ => Err(()),
        }
    }
```
