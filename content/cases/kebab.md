_Kebab case_ is the lower pattern with the hyphen `-` delimiter.

## Synonyms

- _Dash case_ or _Hyphen case_

## History

While the usage of kebab case has been around for a long time, the earliest known record of its name dates to July 23, 2013 by user Ben Lee in [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11273282/whats-the-name-for-hyphen-separated-case).

## Usage

Kebab case is used in HTML/CSS as class and id names.

```html
<div class="large-box">
    <span id="page-title">Welcome!</span>
</div>
```

It is not commonly used as identifiers for variables or functions in programming languages because the hyphen `-` is used to represent subtraction, and can't be used in identifiers.
